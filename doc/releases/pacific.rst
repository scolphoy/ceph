Upgrading from pre-Octopus releases (like Nautilus)
---------------------------------------------------

You *must* first upgrade to Nautilus (14.2.z) or Octopus (15.2.z) before
upgrading to Pacific.


Notable Changes
---------------

* New ``bluestore_rocksdb_options_annex`` config parameter. Complements
  ``bluestore_rocksdb_options`` and allows setting rocksdb options without
  repeating the existing defaults.

* The cephfs addes two new CDentry tags, 'I' --> 'i' and 'L' --> 'l', and
  on-RADOS metadata is no longer backwards compatible after upgraded to Pacific
  or a later release.

* $pid expansion in config paths like ``admin_socket`` will now properly expand
  to the daemon pid for commands like ``ceph-mds`` or ``ceph-osd``. Previously
  only ``ceph-fuse``/``rbd-nbd`` expanded ``$pid`` with the actual daemon pid.

* The allowable options for some ``radosgw-admin`` commands have been changed.

  * ``mdlog-list``, ``datalog-list``, ``sync-error-list`` no longer accepts
    start and end dates, but does accept a single optional start marker.
  * ``mdlog-trim``, ``datalog-trim``, ``sync-error-trim`` only accept a
    single marker giving the end of the trimmed range.
  * Similarly the date ranges and marker ranges have been removed on
    the RESTful DATALog and MDLog list and trim operations.

* ceph-volume: The ``lvm batch`` subcommand received a major rewrite. This
  closed a number of bugs and improves usability in terms of size specification
  and calculation, as well as idempotency behaviour and disk replacement 
  process.
  Please refer to https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/ceph-volume/lvm/batch/ for
  more detailed information.

* Configuration variables for permitted scrub times have changed.  The legal
  values for ``osd_scrub_begin_hour`` and ``osd_scrub_end_hour`` are 0 - 23.
  The use of 24 is now illegal.  Specifying ``0`` for both values causes every
  hour to be allowed.  The legal vaues for ``osd_scrub_begin_week_day`` and
  ``osd_scrub_end_week_day`` are 0 - 6.  The use of 7 is now illegal.
  Specifying ``0`` for both values causes every day of the week to be allowed.

* Multiple file systems in a single Ceph cluster is now stable. New Ceph clusters
  enable support for multiple file systems by default. Existing clusters
  must still set the "enable_multiple" flag on the fs. Please see the CephFS
  documentation for more information.

* volume/nfs: Recently "ganesha-" prefix from cluster id and nfs-ganesha common
  config object was removed, to ensure consistent namespace across different
  orchestrator backends. Please delete any existing nfs-ganesha clusters prior
  to upgrading and redeploy new clusters after upgrading to Pacific.

* A new health check, DAEMON_OLD_VERSION, will warn if different versions of Ceph are running
  on daemons. It will generate a health error if multiple versions are detected.
  This condition must exist for over mon_warn_older_version_delay (set to 1 week by default) in order for the
  health condition to be triggered.  This allows most upgrades to proceed
  without falsely seeing the warning.  If upgrade is paused for an extended
  time period, health mute can be used like this
  "ceph health mute DAEMON_OLD_VERSION --sticky".  In this case after
  upgrade has finished use "ceph health unmute DAEMON_OLD_VERSION".

* MGR: progress module can now be turned on/off, using the commands:
  ``ceph progress on`` and ``ceph progress off``.
* An AWS-compliant API: "GetTopicAttributes" was added to replace the existing "GetTopic" API. The new API
  should be used to fetch information about topics used for bucket notifications.

* librbd: The shared, read-only parent cache's config option ``immutable_object_cache_watermark`` now has been updated
  to property reflect the upper cache utilization before space is reclaimed. The default ``immutable_object_cache_watermark``
  now is ``0.9``. If the capacity reaches 90% the daemon will delete cold cache.

* Scrubs are more aggressive in trying to find more simultaneous possible PGs within osd_max_scrubs limitation.
  It is possible that increasing osd_scrub_sleep may be necessary to maintain client responsiveness.

* OSD: the option ``osd_fast_shutdown_notify_mon`` has been introduced to allow
  the OSD to notify the monitor it is shutting down even if ``osd_fast_shutdown``
  is enabled. This helps with the monitor logs on larger clusters, that may get
  many 'osd.X reported immediately failed by osd.Y' messages, and confuse tools.
